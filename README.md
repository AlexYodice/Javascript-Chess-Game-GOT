Additional Features
Flipping the Board
To provide a different perspective, you can click the "Flip Board" button located at the bottom left corner. This will rotate the board, allowing you to view the game from the opponent's perspective.

Promoting Pawns
When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to a different piece, typically a queen. This represents the pawn's transformation into a more powerful piece. The pawn can be promoted by moving it to the last row and selecting the desired promotion piece.
